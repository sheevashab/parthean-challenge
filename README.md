## Questions
1. I spent a total of 2 hours on this assessment. As I have never created an application with React Native, I took time to reference the documentation and watch some YouTube tutorials.
2. If I could restart the challenge, I would re-assess my approach to state. Currently I have the answers as objects in a data array, but I am sure there is a way to manage state more efficiently as the app grows to more than one question.
3. If I had more time, I would build out the functionality of the answer keys and spend time working on the second screen. Furthermore, I would connect the app to an api so that it could provide an almost infinite amount of questions, keep score of points for correct answers, and improve styling.
